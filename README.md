# Dietary Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing dietary habits based on survey data collected from participants. The objective is to preprocess the data, handle categorical variables, and train a machine learning model to predict whether individuals consult a nutritionist/dietician based on their dietary habits.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named `Dietary.csv`. It contains various columns related to dietary habits, age, meal frequency, and more. Key columns include:

- **Gender**: The gender of the participant.
- **How many meals do you have a day?**: The number of meals consumed daily.
- **Choose all that apply: [I consult a nutritionist/dietician]**: Indicates the participant's consultation with a nutritionist/dietician.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning functionalities, including model training and evaluation.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Import Libraries
Necessary libraries are imported to facilitate data manipulation and model training.

### 2. Load the Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- **Age Encoding**: The 'Age' column is converted into dummy variables for better analysis.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical columns are one-hot encoded to convert them into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

### 4. Cleaning the Data
Unnecessary columns related to nutritionist consultation are dropped, and the 'Often' column is updated based on the values of the 'Never' column.

### 5. True Value Count
Counts of true values in the 'Often' and 'Never' columns are calculated to understand the distribution of responses.

## Model Training
The project aims to train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) to predict dietary consultation behavior based on the preprocessed data.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into dietary habits and highlights the importance of consulting with nutritionists/dieticians for better health management. Further improvements can be made by exploring additional models, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizing the results.

## Future Work
- Implement additional machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Enhance data visualization to better understand dietary patterns.
- Explore the effects of other factors (e.g., age, gender) on dietary consultation behavior.
